Parameters:
  EipMask:
    Type: Number
    Description: >-
      The mask of the contiguous EIP group. Valid values:

      28: 16 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.

      27: 32 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.

      26: 64 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.

      25: 128 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.

      24: 256 contiguous EIPs are allocated for one call.

      Note The actual number of assigned EIPs may be less than the expected
      number because one,

      three, or four EIPs may be reserved.
    AllowedValues:
      - 28
      - 27
      - 26
      - 25
      - 24
    Default: 28
  ResourceGroupId:
    Type: String
    Description: The ID of the resource group to which the EIPs belong.
    Default: null
  Netmode:
    Type: String
    Description: >-
      The network type. Valid values:

      public: the Internet. This is the default value. After contiguous EIPs are
      associated with

      cloud resources, the cloud resources can access the Internet by using the
      EIPs.

      hybrid: the hybrid cloud. After contiguous EIPs are associated with cloud
      resources, the

      cloud resources can access the hybrid cloud by using the EIPs.

      Note This network type is available only to users who are added to the
      whitelist. To use

      this network type, contact your customer manager.
    AllowedValues:
      - public
      - hybrid
    Default: public
  Bandwidth:
    Type: Number
    Description: >-
      The maximum bandwidth of the contiguous EIPs. Unit: Mbit/s. Default value:
      5.
    Default: 5
  InternetChargeType:
    Type: String
    Description: >-
      The metering method of the contiguous EIPs. Valid values:

      PayByBandwidth: Fees are charged based on bandwidth usage. This is the
      default value.

      PayByTraffic: Fees are charged based on data transfer.

      Note If the Netmode parameter is set to hybrid, InternetChargeType is set
      to PayByBandwidth.
    AllowedValues:
      - PayByBandwidth
      - PayByTraffic
    Default: PayByBandwidth
Resources:

        - EIPSegment
        - EipSegmentInstanceId
  EipAddresses:
    Description: >-
      List of EIP addresses. like [{"AllocationId": "eip-xxx", "IpAddress":
      "xx.xx.xx.xx"}]
    Value:
      'Fn::GetAtt':
